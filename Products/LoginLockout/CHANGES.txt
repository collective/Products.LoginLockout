Changes

 0.2 2009-04-20 (Dylan Jay)

  - Eggified merged configlet version

  - Started doctest

 2009-03-10 (Kees Hink):

  - Added configlet for viewing failed attempts and resetting accounts from the
    plone control panel.

  - Quite probably, dropped support for pure Zope usage.

 2008-12-18 (Kees HinK):

  - Added installer, using Extensions/Install.py.
    (Unfortunately, Generic Setup does not yet seem to support uninstalling, but
    the methods in setuphandlers.py and the import profile (profiles/default) are
    there for when you want to use them. Just uncomment the relevant zcml
    directives.)

 0.1 (Dylan Jay):

  - Initial Version
